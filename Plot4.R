#note: I decided to plot points, but make the points large and use color compliments (red and blue) to make them 'pop'. I did not
#      wish to use a line chart (implies data continuity that does not exist) and did not think that bar plot was appropriate.
#      Also used a dashed line for the linear fit to help illustrate the trend line
